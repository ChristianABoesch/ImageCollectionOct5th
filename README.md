This is a webpage consisting of squids. After using Stable Diffusion for the past several webpages, this is the first one to contain images all made from DALL-E 2.

Questions:
1. How do I resize images so they're small enough that users won't need to scroll?
2. How could we make the images automatically fade into one another at a faster/slower pace when music is playing?
